## PointGuard

PointGuard is a protocol points system that is validated by an Active Validator Service (AVS) powered by EigenLayer.

The AVS listens to ERC20 or ERC721 contracts and calculates reward points for users. These contracts interface with EigenLayer to ensure that the points awarded to users have been deterministically calculated.

### Features

- **Automated Points Calculation**: Automatically calculates reward points based on user interactions with ERC20 or ERC721 contracts.
- **Restaking Validation**: Utilizes restaking operators to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the points system.
- **Integration with Eigen Layer**: Leverages EigenLayer for deterministic validation of points, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness.

### Use Cases

- **Loyalty Programs**: Implement a loyalty rewards system based on user interactions with your platform.
- **Gaming**: Reward players with points for in-game achievements and activities.
- **DeFi Platforms**: Incentivize users for participating in decentralized finance activities.
