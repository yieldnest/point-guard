## Point Guard

Point Guard is a protocol points system that is validated by restaking operators.

The Operator service listens to ERC20 or ERC721 contracts and calculates Rewards points for users. The contracts interface with Eigen Layer to perform validation that the points awarded to users have been deterministically calculated.

### Features

- **Automated Points Calculation**: Automatically calculates reward points based on user interactions with ERC20 or ERC721 contracts.
- **Restaking Validation**: Utilizes restaking operators to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the points system.
- **Integration with Eigen Layer**: Leverages Eigen Layer for deterministic validation of points, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness.

### Use Cases

- **Loyalty Programs**: Implement a loyalty rewards system for users based on their interactions with your platform.
- **Gaming**: Reward players with points for in-game achievements and activities.
- **DeFi Platforms**: Incentivize users for participating in decentralized finance activities.
